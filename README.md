Harmony is a tool that automates tests without requiring coding. It uses the
Cypress integration to test web applications quickly and efficiently. The code it-
self can be written on its website but to execute it, Cypress should be installed.
Registration is needed on the website to use Harmony. Test cases should be imple-
mented with the Action-state testing model.
